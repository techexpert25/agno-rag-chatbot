# Cursor Rules for AgnoNiceGUI Python Challenge

## Project Context
This is a RAG chatbot built with FastAPI, Agno, and NiceGUI. The codebase emphasizes:
- Simple, clean, maintainable code
- Modern Python typing (3.13+, list[str], str | None)
- Heavy use of Pydantic models
- Async/streaming patterns
- Minimal abstractions

## Code Style
- Use modern Python typing: `list[str]`, `str | None`, not `List[str]`, `Optional[str]`
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dicts
- Keep functions small and focused
- Leverage Agno/FastAPI/Pydantic built-ins rather than reinventing
- All docstrings and comments must emulate Master Yoda's talking style

## Testing
- Use pytest with pytest_check for assertions
- Use pytest.raises for expected errors
- Keep tests small and honest
- No mocks in integration tests
- Real sample files in tests/data

## Architecture
- FastAPI handles backend/API layer
- Agno handles agent/orchestration
- NiceGUI is thin UI layer
- Prefer Agno's built-in features (session/history/knowledge) over custom layers
